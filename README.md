> TODO
> * Use Twig 3 as soon as possible\
>   For more details, see [this issue](https://github.com/slimphp/Twig-View/issues/156).
> * Tests should not be stored in the project directory.\
>   Use the desire package instead (`package/*/tests`).
> * PHP version requirement of `^7.3` could also be `^7.1` instead.
